<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stent</li><li>PTA Balloon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intracranial atherosclerotic disease treatment market comprises primarily two main types: stents and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloons. Stents are used to maintain arterial lumen patency by placement within narrowed vessels, offering support and reducing the risk of restenosis. Conversely, PTA balloons are deployed to expand the narrowed arteries through inflation, optimizing blood flow without leaving a permanent device. Both treatments aim to alleviate symptoms and reduce the risk of stroke associated with intracranial atherosclerosis.</p></p>
