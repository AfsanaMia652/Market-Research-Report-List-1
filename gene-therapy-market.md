<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Viral Gene Therapy</li><li>Non-Viral Gene Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gene therapy market is primarily categorized into viral and non-viral gene therapies. Viral gene therapy utilizes modified viruses to deliver therapeutic genes into cells, capitalizing on their natural ability to infect and introduce genetic material. In contrast, non-viral gene therapy employs alternative methods such as plasmid DNA, liposomes, and nanoparticles to facilitate gene delivery without using viral vectors. Both approaches aim to correct genetic disorders, improve disease outcomes, and are pivotal in advancing personalized medicine and targeted treatments.</p></p>
