<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Annuloplasty Rings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mitral</li><li>Tricuspid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Annuloplasty rings are devices used in cardiac surgery to support the heart valves, specifically the mitral and tricuspid valves, during repair procedures. The mitral annuloplasty market focuses on devices designed to stabilize the mitral valve annulus, enhancing valve function and minimizing regurgitation. In contrast, the tricuspid annuloplasty market targets the tricuspid valve, addressing issues of leakage and structural support. Both markets cater to the growing demand for less invasive heart procedures and improved patient outcomes in cardiovascular health.</p></p>
