<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-water Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity OWS</li><li>Centrifugal OWS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oil-water separator market features two primary types: gravity oil-water separators (OWS) and centrifugal oil-water separators. Gravity OWS relies on the principle of buoyancy, allowing oil to rise and separate from water due to density differences. This method is cost-effective and suitable for larger volumes. In contrast, centrifugal OWS utilizes rotational force to enhance separation efficiency, handling smaller volumes with speed and precision. Both types serve critical roles in industrial applications, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.</p></p>
