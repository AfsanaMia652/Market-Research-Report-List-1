<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Fundus Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mydriatic Fundus Camera</li><li>Non-Mydriatic Fundus Camera</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The portable fundus camera market is primarily categorized into two types: mydriatic and non-mydriatic fundus cameras. Mydriatic fundus cameras require the use of dilating drops to widen the pupil for clearer retinal imaging, often providing enhanced detail. In contrast, non-mydriatic fundus cameras operate without pupil dilation, allowing for easier and quicker patient examinations. This advantage makes them particularly valuable in primary care settings, facilitating broader access to retinal health assessments without the need for extensive preparation.</p></p>
